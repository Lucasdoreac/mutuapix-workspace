```bash
# SSH into backend VPS
ssh root@49.13.26.142

php artisan db:backup --compress

# Verify backup created
ls -lh storage/backups/

# Copy backup to safe location
BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t storage/backups/*.sql.gz | head -1)
cp $BACKUP_FILE ~/backups/pre-mvp-deploy-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql.gz

tail -f /var/www/mutuapix-api/storage/logs/laravel.log

# Watch for errors
grep -i error /var/www/mutuapix-api/storage/logs/laravel.log | tail -20

# Watch PHP-FPM errors
tail -f /var/log/php8.3-fpm.log

# Exit when done
exit
```

#### 5.2 Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check API response times
curl -w "@-" -o /dev/null -s https://api.mutuapix.com/api/v1/health <<'EOF'
\n
Response time: %{time_total}s
HTTP code: %{http_code}
EOF

# Should be < 0.2s for health check
```

#### 5.3 Database Monitoring

```bash
# SSH into backend VPS
ssh root@49.13.26.142

# Check new tables exist
php artisan tinker
>>> \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema::hasTable('support_tickets')
# Should return: true
>>> \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema::hasTable('support_ticket_messages')
# Should return: true
>>> exit

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

**If deployment fails or critical issues found:**

### Quick Rollback (< 5 minutes)

```bash
# SSH into backend VPS
ssh root@49.13.26.142

# Enable maintenance mode
cd /var/www/mutuapix-api
php artisan down --secret=rollback-emergency

# Restore code from backup
cd /var/www
BACKUP_FILE=$(ls -t ~/backups/mutuapix-api-pre-mvp-*.tar.gz | head -1)
rm -rf mutuapix-api/
tar -xzf $BACKUP_FILE

# Restore database
cd mutuapix-api
DB_BACKUP=$(ls -t ~/backups/pre-mvp-deploy-*.sql.gz | head -1)
gunzip -c $DB_BACKUP | mysql -u root -p mutuapix_production

# Clear caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Restart services
systemctl restart php8.3-fpm
pm2 restart mutuapix-api

# Disable maintenance mode
php artisan up

# Verify rollback
curl -s https://api.mutuapix.com/api/v1/health | jq .

# Exit SSH
exit
```

### Database-Only Rollback

**If only migrations need rollback:**

```bash
# SSH into backend VPS
ssh root@49.13.26.142
cd /var/www/mutuapix-api

# Rollback last migration batch
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1

# Or rollback specific migrations
php artisan migrate:rollback --path=database/migrations/2025_10_19_192807_create_support_tickets_table.php
php artisan migrate:rollback --path=database/migrations/2025_10_19_192826_create_support_ticket_messages_table.php
