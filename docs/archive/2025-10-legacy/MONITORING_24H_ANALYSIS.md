## Metrics Summary

### Execution Statistics

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Executions** | 26 checks | ‚úÖ Expected (5 min intervals) |
| **First Execution** | 2025-10-18 23:51:07 | ‚úÖ Correct |
| **Last Execution** | 2025-10-19 02:04:38 | ‚úÖ Recent |
| **Execution Interval** | ~5 minutes | ‚úÖ Correct |
| **Success Rate** | 100% | ‚úÖ Perfect |

**Expected vs Actual:**
- Time elapsed: 2h 13min = 133 minutes
- Expected executions: 133 / 5 = 26.6 checks
- Actual executions: 26 checks
- **Accuracy:** 98% (very close to expected)

### Frontend Health (matrix.mutuapix.com)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Checks** | 26 | ‚úÖ |
| **Successful** | 26 (100%) | ‚úÖ |
| **Failed** | 0 (0%) | ‚úÖ |
| **Average Response Time** | 718ms | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable |
| **Uptime** | 100% | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Response Time Analysis:**
- Min: ~700ms (estimated)
- Max: ~731ms (from logs)
- Average: 718ms
- Trend: Stable

**Note:** 718ms response time is acceptable for frontend with authentication redirect, but could be optimized.

### Backend API Health (api.mutuapix.com)

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Checks** | 26 | ‚úÖ |
| **Successful** | 26 (100%) | ‚úÖ |
| **Failed** | 0 (0%) | ‚úÖ |
| **Average Response Time** | 613ms | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Uptime** | 100% | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Response Time Analysis:**
- Min: ~575ms (from logs)
- Max: ~777ms (from logs)
- Average: 613ms
- Trend: Stable

**Note:** 613ms is within acceptable range for health endpoint with external API checks (Stripe/Bunny).

## Issues Identified

### Issue #1: LaunchAgent Permission Error ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Error:**
```
/bin/bash: /Users/lucascardoso/Desktop/MUTUA/scripts/monitor-health.sh: Operation not permitted
```

**Frequency:** Every execution (26 times)

**Impact:** Low (monitoring still works)

**Root Cause:** macOS security blocking LaunchAgent from executing scripts in `~/Desktop/` directory

**Current Status:** Non-blocking (script executes despite error)

**Recommended Fix:**
```bash
# Move script to ~/scripts/ (already done in previous session)
# But LaunchAgent plist may still reference old path

# Check current LaunchAgent configuration
cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mutuapix.monitor.plist | grep ProgramArguments -A 3
```

**Priority:** Medium (cosmetic error, but clutters logs)

### Issue #2: SSL Certificate Check Failing ‚ùå

**Error:**
```
‚ùå SSL certificate check failed (connection error)
```

**Frequency:** Every execution (26 times)

**Impact:** Low (SSL is actually valid)

**Root Cause:** `openssl s_client` command may need different syntax for macOS

**Current Workaround:** Manual SSL check
```bash
curl -I https://matrix.mutuapix.com | grep -i "SSL\|TLS"
```

**Recommended Fix:**
```bash
# Update SSL check in monitor-health.sh to use curl instead of openssl
# Example:
curl -vI https://matrix.mutuapix.com 2>&1 | grep "SSL certificate verify ok"
```

**Priority:** Low (nice to have, not critical)

### Issue #3: State Persistence Bug üêõ

**Observation:** Every execution shows:
```
üîî Alerts generated:
    - ‚úÖ Frontend recovered (was: )
    - ‚úÖ Backend API recovered (was: )
```

**Root Cause:** State file (`/tmp/mutuapix-monitor-state.json`) not persisting correctly or being reset

**Impact:** Medium (false "recovered" alerts on every run)

**Expected Behavior:** "recovered" alerts should only appear after actual downtime

**Recommended Fix:**
```bash
# Check state file
cat /tmp/mutuapix-monitor-state.json

# Debug: Add state file path validation in script
# Ensure state file is written with correct JSON format
```

**Priority:** Medium (affects alert quality)

## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Trends

**Frontend:**
- Consistent: 700-731ms range
- Variation: ¬±31ms (4.3%)
- Stable: No significant spikes

**Backend:**
- Consistent: 575-777ms range
- Variation: ¬±202ms (33%)
- Stable: Some variation but no downtime

**Recommendation:** Backend variation acceptable given external API calls (Stripe/Bunny caching would help).

### Uptime Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Uptime % = (Successful Checks / Total Checks) √ó 100
```

**Results:**
- Frontend: (26 / 26) √ó 100 = **100%**
- Backend: (26 / 26) √ó 100 = **100%**

**Extrapolated to 30 days:**
- Expected checks: (30 days √ó 24 hours √ó 60 min) / 5 min = 8,640 checks
- If maintaining 100%: **99.99% uptime** (allowing 1-2 failures)
