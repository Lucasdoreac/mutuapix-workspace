## üéØ Core Web Vitals

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
**Score:** 0.00 ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
- **Threshold:** Good < 0.1, Needs Improvement 0.1-0.25, Poor > 0.25
- **Status:** Perfect score - no layout shifts detected
- **Impact:** Users experience stable visual layout during page load

### Field Data (CrUX - Chrome User Experience Report)
**Status:** n/a - No data available yet
- **Note:** New page or low traffic
- **Action:** Continue monitoring as traffic increases

## ‚ö° Performance Insights

### üî¥ Issue Detected: Forced Reflow

**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Layout thrashing (222ms total)

**Description:**
Forced reflow occurs when JavaScript queries geometric properties (like `offsetWidth`) after styles have been invalidated by DOM changes. This forces the browser to recalculate layout synchronously, blocking the main thread.

**Location:**
```
Function: j @ https://matrix.mutuapix.com/_next/static/chunks/6677-1df8eeb747275c1a.js:1:89557
Called from: (anonymous) @ page-a5ddc49fe1652494.js:0:702
Total reflow time: 222 ms
```

**Estimated Savings:** None reported (likely minimal impact)

**Recommendation:**
- Batch DOM reads before writes
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for layout queries
- Consider using CSS transforms instead of layout properties

## üåê Network Conditions

**CPU Throttling:** None
**Network Throttling:** None
**Environment:** Production (unthrottled)

**Note:** Baseline captured under optimal conditions. Real-world performance may vary based on:
- User device capabilities
- Network conditions
- Geographic location
- Time of day (server load)

## üéØ Recommendations

### High Priority (Performance Impact)
1. **Investigate Forced Reflow**
   - Review `6677-1df8eeb747275c1a.js` chunk
   - Identify layout queries after DOM mutations
   - Batch reads before writes
   - **Estimated Impact:** ~200ms improvement

### Medium Priority (Future Monitoring)
2. **Capture Additional Metrics**
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
   - FID (First Input Delay)
   - INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
   - **Tool:** Lighthouse CI

3. **Monitor Field Data (CrUX)**
   - Check back in 28 days
   - Compare lab vs field performance
   - Identify real-user bottlenecks

### Low Priority (Optimization)
4. **Code Splitting Review**
   - Chunk size: Check `6677-1df8eeb747275c1a.js` (appears large)
   - Consider dynamic imports for non-critical code
   - **Tool:** `npm run analyze` (if configured)

## üìä Comparison Baseline

**This is the FIRST baseline capture.**

Future performance traces should be compared against these metrics:
- CLS: 0.00 (maintain)
- Forced Reflow: 222ms (reduce to <100ms)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
- [x] Capture baseline performance trace
- [x] Identify forced reflow issue
- [ ] Configure Lighthouse CI for automated checks

### Short-term (Next Session)
- [ ] Investigate forced reflow in login page chunk
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit for full metrics (LCP, FID, TTI)
- [ ] Set up performance budgets

### Long-term (Ongoing)
- [ ] Monitor CrUX data monthly
- [ ] Compare against competitors
- [ ] Optimize chunk sizes
- [ ] Implement performance regression tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

**MCP Chrome DevTools:**
```javascript
mcp__chrome-devtools__performance_start_trace({
  reload: true,
  autoStop: true
})

mcp__chrome-devtools__performance_analyze_insight({
  insightName: "ForcedReflow"
})
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Automated performance capture
- ‚úÖ Real production environment
- ‚úÖ No manual DevTools needed
- ‚úÖ Reproducible via command

---

## üìù Notes

**Positive Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Perfect CLS score (0.00)
- ‚úÖ No major performance issues detected
- ‚úÖ Page loads successfully
- ‚úÖ Network requests completing

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Forced reflow (222ms) - minor optimization opportunity
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Missing field data - need traffic/time
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Need full Lighthouse audit for complete picture

**Overall Assessment:**
**Performance Status: ‚úÖ GOOD**

The login page performs well with zero layout shifts. The forced reflow issue is minor but should be addressed for optimal performance.
