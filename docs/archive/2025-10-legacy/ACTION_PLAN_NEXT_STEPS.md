      numberOfRuns: 3,
    },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['error', {minScore: 0.8}],
        'categories:accessibility': ['error', {minScore: 0.9}],
        'cumulative-layout-shift': ['error', {maxNumericValue: 0.1}],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

**Deliverable:** Working Lighthouse CI configuration + GitHub workflow

---

### Task 1.3: Configure Slack Notifications ✅
**Time:** 10 minutes
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Steps:**
1. Create Slack incoming webhook
2. Add to environment variables documentation
3. Create example deployment notification script
4. Test notification

**Script:**
```bash
# scripts/notify-slack.sh
#!/bin/bash
WEBHOOK_URL=$1
MESSAGE=$2

curl -X POST "$WEBHOOK_URL" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"text\": \"$MESSAGE\"}"
```

**Deliverable:** Slack notification setup guide + test script

---

## ⚡ PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (30 min)

### Task 2.1: Investigate Forced Reflow ✅
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Steps:**
1. Identify source file: `6677-1df8eeb747275c1a.js`
2. Check Next.js build output for chunk mapping
3. Review login page code for layout queries
4. Document findings

**Known Issue:**
```
Function: j @ 6677-1df8eeb747275c1a.js:1:89557
Called from: page-a5ddc49fe1652494.js:0:702
Impact: 222ms
```

**Deliverable:** Investigation report with recommendations

---

### Task 2.2: Implement Quick Win Fix (if available) ✅
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** LOW (if complex, defer)

**Quick Wins to Check:**
- Move layout queries to `requestAnimationFrame`
- Batch DOM reads before writes
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout properties

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Fix requires < 15 minutes
- Reduces forced reflow by > 50ms
- No breaking changes

**Deliverable:** Code fix + performance comparison

---

## 🏥 PHASE 3: CRITICAL ROADMAP ITEM (1h) ✅ COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN PRODUCTION
**Time Spent:** 15 minutes (validation only)
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-18 00:45 BRT
**Report:** `HEALTH_CHECK_CACHING_VALIDATION.md`

### Task 3.1: Implement Health Check Caching ✅ ALREADY DONE
**Time:** 15 minutes (validation instead of 45 min implementation)
**Priority:** CRITICAL (Roadmap Item #3)

**Current Problem:**
```php
// HealthController.php
public function extended() {
    // Calls Stripe API on EVERY request
    $stripe = $this->checkStripe();

    // Calls Bunny API on EVERY request
    $bunny = $this->checkBunny();
}
```

**Impact:**
- Rate limits hit
- Unnecessary costs
- Slow response (800ms+)

**Solution:**
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache;

public function extended() {
    $stripe = Cache::remember('health:stripe', 300, function() {
        return $this->checkStripe();
    });

    $bunny = Cache::remember('health:bunny', 300, function() {
        return $this->checkBunny();
    });
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Read current HealthController.php
2. Implement caching for Stripe check
3. Implement caching for Bunny check
4. Add timeout to HTTP requests
5. Test locally
6. Deploy to production
7. Verify response time improvement

**Deliverable:** Cached health endpoint + performance metrics

---

### Task 3.2: Validate Health Check Improvement ✅
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** CRITICAL

**Validation:**
```bash
# Before (measure baseline)
time curl https://api.mutuapix.com/api/v1/health/extended

# After deployment
time curl https://api.mutuapix.com/api/v1/health/extended

# Second call (should be cached)
time curl https://api.mutuapix.com/api/v1/health/extended
```

**Expected:**
- First call: ~800ms (unchanged)
- Cached call: < 100ms (8x improvement)

**Deliverable:** Performance comparison report

---

## 🧪 PHASE 4: FRAMEWORK VALIDATION (45 min)

### Task 4.1: Test /deploy-conscious ✅
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Priority:** HIGH

**Test Scenario:**
Deploy health check caching changes using `/deploy-conscious`

**Steps:**
1. Verify all pre-checks pass
2. Create backup
3. Deploy code
4. Run MCP validation
5. Verify health endpoint performance
6. Generate deployment report

**Expected Workflow:**
```
/deploy-conscious target=backend

🧠 CHAIN OF THOUGHT:
  - Analyzing changes: HealthController.php
  - Risk: Medium (external API dependencies)
  - Pre-checks needed: Tests, PHPStan, Pint

✅ STAGE 1: PRE-DEPLOYMENT
  - composer format-check: PASS
  - composer lint: PASS
  - php artisan test: PASS

✅ STAGE 2: PRODUCTION HEALTH
  - PM2: online
  - API health: 200

✅ STAGE 3: BACKUP
  - Created: 2.1GB

✅ STAGE 4: DEPLOY
  - Files transferred
  - Cache cleared
  - Optimized

✅ STAGE 5: RESTART
  - PM2: online

✅ STAGE 6: VALIDATION
  - Health: 200
  - Response time: < 100ms (cached)
  - Logs: Clean

🎉 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL
```

**Deliverable:** Complete deployment report using framework

---

### Task 4.2: Document Learnings ✅
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Documentation:**
1. What went well
2. What could improve
3. Framework adjustments needed
4. Update CLAUDE.md with findings

**Deliverable:** Lessons learned document

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### If UptimeRobot Setup Fails
**Fallback:** Skip for now, continue with next task
**Impact:** Low (Sentry still provides error monitoring)
**Time Lost:** 0 minutes (move on)

### If Lighthouse CI Fails
**Fallback:** Configuration only, test manually later
**Impact:** Low (can validate in next session)
**Time Lost:** 0 minutes (defer testing)

### If Health Check Caching Breaks
**Rollback Plan:**
1. Restore from backup (< 2 minutes)
2. PM2 restart
3. Verify original health endpoint works
**Impact:** Medium (temporary downtime during rollback)
**Mitigation:** Test locally first, validate before deploy

### If /deploy-conscious Has Issues
**Fallback:** Manual deployment
**Impact:** Low (framework is tested, manual works)
**Time Lost:** 10 minutes extra (manual steps)
