# Skills System Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Session:** Authentication audit follow-up + Skills implementation
**Duration:** ~2 hours

---

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Skills System Created (Self-Improving Documentation)

Implemented **Claude Code Skills** pattern for modular, auto-updating documentation following progressive disclosure principle.

**Created 3 Skills:**

#### Authentication Management Skill
- **File:** `.claude/skills/authentication-management/SKILL.md` (11.5KB)
- **Purpose:** Complete guide to Laravel Sanctum + Next.js authentication
- **Includes:**
  - Production login flow (CSRF ‚Üí Login ‚Üí JWT token storage)
  - Mock mode security validation
  - Environment detection (critical for security)
  - Deployment checklist with MCP verification
  - Troubleshooting guide (4 common issues with solutions)
  - Post-deployment verification using MCP Chrome DevTools

#### PIX Validation Expert Skill
- **File:** `.claude/skills/pix-validation/SKILL.md` (6.8KB)
- **Purpose:** Enforce PIX email matching business rule
- **Critical Rule:** User's login email MUST equal PIX key email for payments
- **Includes:**
  - Database schema documentation
  - Current validation logic (incomplete)
  - Required validation implementation (code examples)
  - Testing scenarios (3 test cases)
  - Implementation checklist

#### Documentation Updater Skill
- **File:** `.claude/skills/documentation-updater/SKILL.md` (9.2KB)
- **Purpose:** Auto-update CLAUDE.md when new patterns discovered
- **Includes:**
  - 5 auto-update triggers (commands, configs, security, skills, workflows)
  - Update workflow (5-step process)
  - CLAUDE.md structure guidelines
  - Self-improvement loop
  - Documentation health metrics
  - Quality checks before updates

### 2. CLAUDE.md Enhanced with Critical Information

**Added Sections:**

#### Skills System (Top of file)
- Overview of 3 available skills
- How skills work (progressive disclosure)
- When to read a skill (with commands)
- Auto-discovery from `.claude/skills/`

#### Critical Business Rules (After Project Overview)
- **PIX Email Validation** - Prominent warning about email matching requirement
- Database schema reference
- Validation rules (3 rules)
- Implementation TODO checklist
- Link to detailed skill

#### Authentication System
- Quick reference (stack, token lifetime, CSRF)
- Quick test commands (2 curl examples)
- Critical security issues (3 items with severity)
- Production environment variables
- Link to detailed skill + audit report

#### Documentation Version History (End of file)
- Tracks major CLAUDE.md changes over time
- 4 versions documented (2025-10-11 to 2025-10-16)
- Shows what was added, fixed, removed each session

**Updated:**
- Last Updated date: 2025-10-16
- Auto-Update Enabled: ‚úÖ flag
- Cross-references to skills and audit reports

---

### 3. Documentation Discovered via Research

**Web Research Findings:**

#### Skills Best Practices (from Anthropic docs)
- Skills are model-invoked (Claude decides when to use)
- YAML frontmatter required (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`)
- Progressive disclosure is core design principle
- Can include unlimited supporting files
- Distributed via git repositories or plugins

#### CLAUDE.md Best Practices
- Keep concise (<50KB total)
- Use bullet points over paragraphs
- Include copy-pasteable commands
- Treat as living document (iterate)
- Update during sessions (not after)
- Self-optimization loop (learn from failures)

## üîç Key Discoveries from User Request

### PIX Email Validation Requirement

**User Statement:** "tem tamb√©m o fato de que o email aqui usado deve ser o mesmo da chave pix que ser√° usada"

**Investigation Results:**
- ‚úÖ Found database schema: `users.pix_key`, `users.pix_key_type`
- ‚úÖ Found middleware: `CheckPixKey.php` (exists but incomplete)
- ‚ùå Email matching validation NOT implemented
- ‚ùå Auto-population of PIX key during registration NOT implemented

**Action Taken:**
- Documented requirement prominently in CLAUDE.md
- Created comprehensive PIX Validation Expert skill
- Provided implementation code examples
- Added to TODO checklist

---

## üß† How Skills Work

### Discovery Mechanism

Skills are automatically discovered from:
```bash
# 1. Project-level skills (shared with team via git)
.claude/skills/authentication-management/
.claude/skills/pix-validation/
.claude/skills/documentation-updater/

# 2. Personal skills (not committed)
~/.claude/skills/

# 3. Plugin skills (from installed plugins)
```

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

```
CLAUDE.md (Quick Reference)
    ‚Üì
  Need more detail?
    ‚Üì
SKILL.md (In-depth Guide)
    ‚Üì
  Need supporting context?
    ‚Üì
Audit Reports, README, etc.
```

**Benefits:**
- CLAUDE.md stays concise (<50KB)
- Detailed info loaded only when needed
- Unbounded context via skills

### When Claude Reads a Skill

**Automatically:**
- At session start: Loads skill names + descriptions
- During task: Reads full SKILL.md if relevant to task

**Manually (by user request):**
```bash
# User can ask: "Read the authentication skill"
# Claude executes:
cat .claude/skills/authentication-management/SKILL.md
```

---

## üîÑ Self-Improvement Loop

### How Documentation Auto-Updates

**Trigger Examples:**

1. **New Command Discovered**
   ```bash
   # Session: Discovered that clearing .next cache is required
   ssh root@138.199.162.115 'rm -rf .next && npm run build'

   # Auto-Update CLAUDE.md:
   ## Deployment > Frontend
   # Clear cache before rebuild (required for env var changes)
   ssh root@138.199.162.115 'rm -rf .next && npm run build'
   ```

2. **Security Issue Found**
   ```typescript
   // Discovered: authStore has mock user by default

   // Auto-Create: SECURITY_AUDIT_2025_10_16.md
   // Auto-Update CLAUDE.md > Security > Known Issues
   ```

3. **New Skill Created**
   ```bash
   # Created: .claude/skills/new-skill/SKILL.md

   # Auto-Update CLAUDE.md:
   ## Available Skills
   4. **New Skill Name** - Description
   ```

### Workflow

1. **Discovery** - Encounter new information during session
2. **Validation** - Is it accurate? Useful for future?
3. **Update** - Edit CLAUDE.md or SKILL.md
4. **Verification** - Read back, check clarity
5. **Commit** - Git commit with descriptive message

## üîê Security Considerations

**Skills as Attack Vector?**

Skills are **Markdown files** with embedded code examples, not executable code. Claude reads them as instructions.

**Security Best Practices:**

‚úÖ Commit skills to git (version controlled)
‚úÖ Review skill updates before committing
‚úÖ Never include secrets in skills
‚úÖ Use `.env.example` patterns for sensitive config
‚úÖ Personal skills in `~/.claude/skills/` (not committed)

**Access Control:**

- Project skills (`.claude/skills/`) ‚Üí Shared with team via git
- Personal skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) ‚Üí Local only
- Plugin skills ‚Üí Managed by plugin system

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Progressive disclosure** keeps CLAUDE.md readable while providing unlimited depth via skills
2. **YAML frontmatter** in skills enables auto-discovery
3. **Version history** in both CLAUDE.md and SKILL.md tracks changes over time
4. **Cross-references** (CLAUDE.md ‚Üî SKILL.md ‚Üî audit reports) create knowledge graph

### What to Improve

1. **Skill naming** - Be more specific (e.g., "Laravel Sanctum Authentication" vs. "Authentication Management")
2. **Update frequency** - Document immediately, don't batch at end of session
3. **Search capability** - Create index of all skills for faster discovery
4. **Testing** - Verify all commands in skills before documenting

### For Next Session

1. Test skills discovery mechanism
2. Implement PIX email validation
3. Create more skills as patterns emerge
4. Continue auto-updating CLAUDE.md
