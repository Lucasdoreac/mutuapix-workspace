## 🎯 Recommended Strategy for Next Session

### Option 1: Manual Application (Recommended) ⭐

Since code is already in production and working, manually apply only the 4 critical fixes:

1. **authStore.ts** - Remove default mock user
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   user: { id: 1, email: 'mock@user.com' }
   // To:
   user: null
   ```

2. **useAuth.ts** - Fix logout state management
   - Ensure proper session cleanup
   - Clear all auth state on logout

3. **login-container.tsx** - Add environment validation
   - Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV`
   - Prevent mock auth in production

4. **api/index.ts** - Fix API base URL
   - Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` from env
   - Remove hardcoded test URLs

**Steps:**
1. Create new branch from main: `fix/auth-security-manual`
2. Manually apply 4 changes above
3. Run tests and build
4. Create clean PR
5. Merge without conflicts

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

### Option 2: Resolve All Conflicts

Manually resolve all 14 file conflicts in PR #7.

**Steps:**
1. Checkout `cleanup/frontend-complete`
2. Merge main
3. Resolve each conflict
4. Test thoroughly
5. Force merge

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours  
**Risk:** High (many conflicts, error-prone)

### Option 3: Close PR #7

Since code is already in production:

**Steps:**
1. Close PR #7 as "already deployed"
2. Document security fixes in production
3. Move on to other work

**Rationale:**
- Code is live and working
- PR was for documentation
- No functional benefit to merging

---

## 📊 Current Status

**Production:**
- ✅ Frontend: All 4 security fixes deployed
- ✅ Backend: HealthController docs deployed
- ✅ Both services healthy

**GitHub:**
- ✅ PR #35: Merged
- ⚠️ PR #7: Conflicts documented
- ✅ Issue #1: Closed
- 📋 Issue #2: Updated
- 📋 Issue #3: Needs update after PR resolution

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Close PR #7** and move forward.

**Reasons:**
1. Code is already in production (2025-10-17)
2. Validated and stable (0 errors)
3. Merge conflicts complex and time-consuming
4. No functional benefit (just documentation)
5. Session already 4+ hours

**Alternative:**
If documentation is important, create a simple markdown file documenting the 4 security fixes that were deployed, without needing to merge the PR.

## 📅 Next Session Actions

**If closing PR #7:**
1. Close PR with explanation
2. Update Issue #3
3. Move to Week 2 tasks

**If manual application:**
1. Create `fix/auth-security-manual` branch
2. Apply 4 fixes manually
3. Test and create clean PR
4. Merge and close Issue #3

**If resolving conflicts:**
1. Allocate 2-3 hours
2. Resolve conflicts systematically
3. Test extensively
4. Merge and close Issue #3

**Session Duration:** 4+ hours  
**Recommendation:** Close PR #7 and move forward ⭐  
**Rationale:** Production > Documentation
