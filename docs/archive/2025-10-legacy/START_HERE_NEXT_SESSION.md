**Impact:** Low (email sending, not registration logic)
**Status:** Can be fixed post-launch
**Priority:** Low

### 2. Missing Tests
**Issue:** Subscriptions and Course Progress have no dedicated tests
**Impact:** Medium (features work, just not test-covered)
**Status:** Recommended for post-launch
**Priority:** Medium

### 3. PIX Test Failure (1/6)
**Issue:** One PIX test fails (new_user_registration_auto_populates_pix_key_with_email)
**Impact:** Low (related to WelcomeMail bug)
**Status:** Non-blocking
**Priority:** Low

**Note:** None of these issues block production deployment. All critical features work correctly.
