## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### Bug #1: Validation Error Response Format ✅
**Issue:** ApiResponseHelper::error() signature mismatch
**Fix:** Use validationError($validator->errors()->toArray())
**Impact:** All validation responses now properly formatted

### Bug #2: Permission Guard Mismatch ✅
**Issue:** Permission created for 'web' guard but checked on 'sanctum'
**Fix:** Create permission with 'guard_name: sanctum'
**Impact:** All authorization checks working correctly

### Bug #3: JSON Response Structure ✅
**Issue:** Test expected 'data.data' but response has 'data'
**Fix:** Updated test to read correct response structure
**Impact:** Pagination working correctly

### Bug #4: Error Response Helpers ✅
**Issue:** Using generic error() instead of specific helpers
**Fix:** Use notFound() for 404, forbidden() for 403
**Impact:** Consistent error response format
