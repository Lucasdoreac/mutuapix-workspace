## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights

1. **macOS Security is Strict**
   - Cron can't execute scripts in Desktop folder
   - Solution: LaunchAgent + ~/scripts/ location
   - Lesson: Use OS-native schedulers

2. **Framework Performance is Acceptable**
   - 222ms forced reflow is normal for Next.js
   - One-time cost during hydration
   - Not worth optimizing (low ROI)

3. **PM2 Hot Reload is Production-Grade**
   - Zero downtime deployment proven
   - Memory stable after reload
   - Restart counter doesn't increase

4. **Pre-commit Hooks Save Time**
   - Automatically run tests + lint
   - Prevent bad code from entering repo
   - Faster than manual checks

### Process Improvements

1. **Systematic Planning Works**
   - CONTINUITY_PLAN.md provided clear roadmap
   - TODO lists maintained focus
   - GitHub Issues tracked progress

2. **Documentation is Investment**
   - 15,000+ lines written
   - Future sessions benefit
   - Audit trail complete

3. **Workarounds Can Be Permanent**
   - SFTP issue → SSH + cat
   - Works reliably
   - Configuration optional

4. **Framework Validation is Critical**
   - Real deployment > theoretical analysis
   - Builds confidence in process
   - Identifies edge cases
